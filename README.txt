AUDIENCE: BTech CSE Students 

The purpose of this project is to make DS subject easier to all students. Every student should be able to understand arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists and trees.
They should understand building these datastructures and operations we perform using them. Such as adding, searching, deleting, printing...


HOW EXACTLY WILL THIS HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND DATA STRUCTURES? Simple, I will explain each single line of code thorough comments(unknown to solution).
And i will write outline of every single function. So you'd have outline of function and every step to reach the solution. Unfortunately, You should be good in C and be able to write 
simple programs to understand this. You could watch youtube for that. Takes a week to get good, that's it.

Just began, so project is incomplete and unreadable. Will take few months to get good.
